# Tic-Tac-Toe Game
A simple in console Tic-Tac-Toe game created in the Spring of 2015. Using a 3x3 2D array, the game allows a user to play a game of Tic-Tac-Toe against an A.I. Well, a very simple A.I. that is. Being one of my first Java programs, the computer does not choose its square (In this case array position) with any real strategy. Rather, it finds the first empty space and places its mark there. 


### Directions:
* The user chooses heads or tails to determine who goes first. 
* They are then prompted to enter the row and column of the square where they want to place their 'X' or 'O'. For example, 11 or 12. 
* If the user enters a row or column outside the parameters of the game (A row or column larger than 3) they will be prompted again.

**Note:** The method used to determine a draw is very simple, only declaring if there aren't any available spaces.
